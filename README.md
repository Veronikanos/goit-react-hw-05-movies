# Homework 5 by React course, GoIT school - Movies (React Router)

This project was bootstrapped with
[React homework template](https://github.com/goitacademy/react-homework-template).

You can find live page
[here](https://veronikanos.github.io/goit-react-hw-05-movies/).

This task was accomplished using react hooks and was refactored from class
components and lifecycle stages as it was at previous
[version](https://github.com/Veronikanos/goit-react-hw-03-image-finder/).

There is a separate file for each component in the src/components folder.
Styling is done by CSS modules
